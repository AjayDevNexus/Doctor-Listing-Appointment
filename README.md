# Doctor Listing Application
A web application built with Next.js (frontend) and Express.js (backend) using MongoDB as a NoSQL database. This project allows patients to view a filtered list of doctors, book appointments, and provides an admin interface to manage doctors (add/delete) and view appointments. The design is inspired by https://www.apollo247.com/specialities/general-physician-internal-medicine.
Features

Patient View:
View a list of doctors with filters by specialty (e.g., General Physician, Internal Medicine) and pagination.
Book appointments with doctors by providing patient name, date, and time.


Admin View:
Log in to add or delete doctors.
View a list of appointments made by patients.


Role-Based Access: Basic admin authentication to restrict management features.
SEO Optimization: Built with Next.js for off-page SEO support (customizable via meta tags).
Responsive Design: Grid layout for doctor listings and appointment displays.

Prerequisites

Node.js (v14.x or later)
MongoDB (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)
npm (comes with Node.js)

Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/doctor-listing.git
cd doctor-listing

2. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages for both frontend and backend:
npm install

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/doctor-listing
PORT=5000


Replace mongodb://localhost:27017/doctor-listing with your MongoDB URI if using a remote database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
Ensure MongoDB is running locally (mongod) or your remote database is accessible.

4. Start the Application
Run the Backend Server
In one terminal, start the Express server:
npm run server

This starts the backend on http://localhost:5000.
Run the Frontend
In another terminal, start the Next.js development server:
npm run dev

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the application.
Build for Production
To run in production mode:
npm run build
npm start

This builds the app and starts the production server on http://localhost:3000.

Troubleshooting

MongoDB Connection Error:
Ensure MongoDB is running and the MONGO_URI in .env is correct.


Build Errors:
Delete the .next directory and rerun npm run dev or npm run build.


OneDrive Issues:
Move the project out of a synced OneDrive folder to avoid file system conflicts (e.g., from C:\Users\AJAY\OneDrive\Documents\Web development\doctor-listing to C:\Users\AJAY\Documents\doctor-listing).


React Errors:
Ensure import React is included in files using React features (e.g., pages/_app.js).
