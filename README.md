# Doctor Listing Application

A web application built with Next.js (frontend) and Express.js (backend) using MongoDB as a NoSQL database. This project allows patients to view a filtered list of doctors, book appointments, and provides an admin interface to manage doctors (add/delete) and view appointments. The design is inspired by `https://www.apollo247.com/specialities/general-physician-internal-medicine`.

## Features
- **Patient View**:
  - View a list of doctors with filters by specialty (e.g., General Physician, Internal Medicine) and pagination.
  - Book appointments with doctors by providing patient name, date, and time.
- **Admin View**:
  - Log in to add or delete doctors.
  - View a list of appointments made by patients.
- **Role-Based Access**: Basic admin authentication to restrict management features.
- **SEO Optimization**: Built with Next.js for off-page SEO support (customizable via meta tags).
- **Responsive Design**: Grid layout for doctor listings and appointment displays.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **MongoDB** (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)
